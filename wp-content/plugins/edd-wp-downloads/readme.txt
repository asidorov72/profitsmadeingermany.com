Add WordPress.org plugins and themes as downloads in Easy Digital Downloads.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to add WordPress.org plugins and themes as free downloads in Easy Digital Downloads.


When you add a WordPress.org plugin or theme URL to a download, the add to cart / buy now buttons will be replaced with a "Free Download" button that links to the Wordpress.org plugin/theme page instead.

This plugin also adds a helpful widget that displays info such as the download count, dates added/last updated, current version, and more. This info is cached via transients so it will work well on high traffic servers, and only displays on downloads added as WordPress.org downloads.

== Installation ==
Install this plugin like you would install any other WordPress plugin.

Dashboard Method:

1. Login to your WordPress admin and go to Plugins -> Add New
2. Type "EDD WordPress.org Downloads" in the search bar and select this plugin
3. Click "Install", and then "Activate Plugin"


Upload Method:

1. Unzip the plugin and upload the "edd-wordpress-downloads" folder to your "wp-content/plugins" directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==
